# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Expo - Environment Setup](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/)

## Step 1: Start your Application

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: launch on virtual device or physical device

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from your andorid or iOS device respectively.
